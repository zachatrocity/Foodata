#teamwork
Zach:
	Built the home, sassyfats, and calcounter pages. Created the base/skeleton of the fuzzy search on the home page.
	Built the animations using animate.css
	
	
Brock:
	Build the update, and create pages. Enhanced the fuzzy search algorithm by adding a ranking system to sort
	the results	in a way that makes sense. 
	
	
Both:
	Initialized the Entity database and the seed function, created the architecture/skeleton of the app.
